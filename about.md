**With a background in both Social Psychology and Algorithmic Accountability, I am a highly skilled transdisciplinary researcher. As the current Head of Research at Tracking Exposed, I have honed my abilities in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. My expertise lies in assessing the impact of so-called Artificial Intelligence on society, with a specific focus on privacy and digital rights. I have a proven track record of success in this field, and my work has been widely recognized and I have been interviewed by several international news outlets. In my role, I have been able to expertly navigate the intersection of media campaigns, academic research, and digital forensics to drive strategic litigation. I hold a degree in Social Psychology from the University of Padova and have built a strong network of collaborations, particularly with the Media Studies department at Amsterdam University.

When I'm not working to promote Algorithmic Accountability and protecting digital rights, you can find me out on the trails, taking on challenging hikes along the beautiful seaside. I am also deeply passionate about making a positive impact on the world, and actively work to promote climate and social justice through various social movements.**

<!-- 
I graduated in social psychology from the University of Padova and I developed my interest in studying social media and algorithms during my collaboration with the [DatActive](https://data-activism.net/about/) team at the University of Amsterdam.

I am currently working on algorithmic accountability and hate speech discourses on social media, specifically focusing on the political sphere. 

As a member of the [tracking.exposed](https://tracking.exposed/) research team, I investigate [Youtube](https://youtube.tracking.exposed/) and [Pornhub's](https://pornhub.tracking.exposed/) algorithms. 
You can take a look at  my last works on algorithmic [Polarization](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2021FIterTube) and [Heteronormativity](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18OGpOiEmyosq3VK_Ogn_smeGq9kWx-Sl/view?usp=sharing).

As a member of the"[Rete Nazionale per il contrasto ai linguaggi e ai fenomeni d'odio](https://www.retecontrolodio.org/chi-siamo/)", I work on text analysis on large corpus of text, such as social media's comments.
You can read my [master thesis](https://github.com/SalvatoreRomano1/thesis) on the relationship between political communication and hate speech.

I have been a teaching assistant for the University of Padova in the courses of "Persuasion and social influence" and "Social Network Analysis"; check the report of the teamwork I facilitated on [Semantic and Network analysis of Hate Speech](https://github.com/SalvatoreRomano1/net2020)

I collaborated with the Media Studies department of Amsterdam University; check the report of the last data sprint I facilitated during the previous [Digital Methods Winter School](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2021) on "[Echo Chambers, Filter Bubble and Polarization on Youtube during the USA's post-electoral debate](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/WinterSchool2021FIterTube)".
